Comments can include **Markdown** text, which allows basic styles to be applied to the text.

You can have unordered lists, like:

* A line
* Another line
  * A sub list
  * Again
* Back again

Or ordered lists, like:

1) First
2) Second
3) Third

It is possible to mark text as `code { like: this }` or to define a block of text as code:

```js
var i = 1;
var j = 10;
for(i = 1; j != i; i++) {
  console.log(i * j);
}
```

You can also [create hyper links](#) which point to other places.
