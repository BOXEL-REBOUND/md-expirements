# Markdown and VS Code

Working with Markdown files in Visual Studio Code is simple, straightforward, and fun. Besides VS Code's basic editing, there are a number of Markdown specific features that will help you be more productive.

## Markdown Extensions

In addition to the functionality VS Code provides out of the box, you can install an extension for greater functionality.

> Tip: The extensions shown above are dynamically queried. Click on an extension tile above to read the description and reviews to decide which extension is best for you. See more in the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com).

## Markdown Preview

VS Code supports Markdown files out of the box. You just start writing Markdown text, save the file with the `.md` extension and then you can toggle the visualization of the editor between the code and the preview of the Markdown file; obviously, you can also open an existing Markdown file and start working on it. To switch between views, press `kb(markdown.showPreview)` in the editor. You can view the preview side-by-side (`kb(markdown.showPreviewToSide)`)
